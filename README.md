Project Summary: PCARS W4MLB Club Station Band Display

This project supports the Platinum Coast Amateur Radio Club (PCARS) by providing a Band Display system for the W4MLB Club Station. The display shows which operating band and mode are currently in use for Stations 1 and 2, helping operators avoid interference. If both stations are tuned to the same band, a buzzer sounds after three seconds to alert users of the conflict. This system promotes efficient and coordinated operation within the club station.
