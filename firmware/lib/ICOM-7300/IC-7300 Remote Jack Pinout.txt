        4.7kΩ Pull-up resistor between the collector and 5V to ensure proper signal reading.



The pull-up resistor for the CI-V bus is inside the radio, but its presence and value depend on the specific Icom model and settings.
Inside the Radio:

    Most Icom radios (including the IC-7300) have an internal pull-up resistor on the CI-V data line.

    The typical value is around 4.7kΩ - 10kΩ, pulling the line up to 5V.

    This allows multiple devices (tuner, amp, PC, etc.) to share the same single-wire bus.


How to Check If a Pull-Up Resistor Exists

    Measure Voltage on the CI-V Tip (Idle State)

        Disconnect any external CI-V devices.

        Use a multimeter to measure the voltage between the tip (data line) and sleeve (ground) of the 3.5mm CI-V jack.

        If the voltage is ~5V, the radio has an internal pull-up.

        If the voltage is ~0V, the radio may not have a pull-up, or it only activates when a device is connected.

    Use an Oscilloscope or Logic Analyzer

        Observe the CI-V bus while the radio transmits data.

        If the high level is weak or unstable, an external pull-up may help.
